    documents, attachments, and reports.

    The file can be associated with the URI of another identifiable object
    (for example, a parentUri). Every file must have an assigned content type
    and name. Files can be retrieved individually by using the file's
    identifier or as a list of files by using a parentUri. Each file has its
    content stream associated with it.  After creation, the metadata that is
    associated with the file or the actual content can be updated. A single
    file can be deleted by using a specific ID. Multiple files can be deleted
    by specifying a parentUri.  A file can be uploaded via raw request or
    multipart form request.

    "## Introduction \n",
    "In this notebook, we will connect to SAS Viya from Python using the SWAT package. Using SWAT, we will use the Data Science Pilot action set to build automated machine learning models using the power of SAS analytics. Next, we will create a simple XGBOOST model pipeline, which will push into the SAS model repository service to demonstrate Viya's ability to consume different types of models! Finally, we will use the SASCTL and PZMM packages to generate model metadata and push our SAS models and our native Python model into the model repository service. More information about SWAT, Data Science Pilot, SASCTL and PZMM are available below.\n",

    "### The Scripting Wrapper for Analytics Transfer Package\n",
    "The [SAS SWAT (Scripting Wrapper for Analytics Transfer) package for Python](https://sassoftware.github.io/python-swat/index.html) is a Python interface to the SAS Cloud Analytic Services (CAS) engine (the centerpiece of the SAS Viya framework). SWAT allows Python programmers to load and access data stored in Viya as CASTables as well as execute CAS actions upon the data stored in CAS. CAS Action Sets are akin to libraries and CAS Actions can be thought of as functions. Examples and syntax for utilizing CAS actions in Python are readily available in the [documentation](https://go.documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=pgmsascdc&cdcVersion=v_006&docsetId=casactml&docsetTarget=titlepage.htm&locale=en). SWAT accesses the CAS Engine using our Open API Framework. Notice in the image below that programmers can interface with CASTables using a familiar pandas-like syntax. With the best-of-breed SAS analytics in the cloud and the use of Python and its large collection of open source packages, the SWAT package gives you access to the best of both worlds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data Science Pilot Action Set\n",
    "The Data Science Pilot Action Set is included with SAS Visual Data Mining and Machine Learning (VDMML) and consists of actions that implement a policy-based, configurable, and scalable approach to automating data science workflows. These actions allow you to move from a data set to a deployable model in a flash! A deeper dive into the data science can be found in [my blog series](https://blogs.sas.com/content/tag/data-science-pilot-explained/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The SASCTL and PZMM Packages\n",
    "The SASCTL and PZMM Packages are incredibly helpful with model metadata, management and governance. SASCTL and PZMM enable you to easily put models built using CAS actions or purely python into our model repository and save important metadata with those models. You can also publish the models for easily deployment, monitor model performance, or access our workflow service. SASCTL and PZMM access the model management and model deployment microservices using our open API framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a better understanding of SAS Open Source packages, let's get started!\n",
    "***\n",
    "## Gather Resources \n",
    "First, we will import necessary packages."

    "[Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service/) provides access to Large Language Models (LLMs) through REST API, their Python SDK, and a web-based interface in the Azure OpenAI studio. Various models are available out of the box, including GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo with Vision, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and Embeddings model series. For more information about the Azure OpenAI Service, [this article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/overview). To incorporate these models in SAS Intelligent Decisioning and SAS Model Manager, you create a Python function and score code by calling the REST API of a GPT-3.5-Turbo model deployed in Azure OpenAI. At the time of writing this notebook, the Python SDK does not support all calls to each model type, but that might change in the future. This example also walks you through the steps that are required for deploying the model, based on what was required when this example was created.  \n",

    "## Deploying a GPT Model in Azure OpenAI\n",
    "Access to Azure OpenAI service must be requested and approved. You can determine whether you qualify for access and submit your request using [this form]( https://customervoice.microsoft.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR7en2Ais5pxKtso_Pz4b1_xUNTZBNzRKNlVQSFhZMU9aV09EVzYxWFdORCQlQCN0PWcu). After access is granted, you must create an Azure OpenAI Service resource and deploy your model. [This tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal) walks you through setting up an Azure OpenAI Service and deploying a model in a few simple steps. GPT-3.5-Turbo is used for this example, but not all models are available in all regions. Next, it is recommended that you walk through [this tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/quickstart?pivots=rest-api&tabs=command-line%2Cpython) with REST as your preferred method. Make sure that you save your endpoint, API-key, and deployment name, because they are needed for the next steps. Run the cell below and then save each of them using the input boxes that appear.   "

    "## Considerations for Key Management\n",
    "Even though the cell above collects your API key, it uses the GetPass package to hide your key from view. With the endpoint, deployment name, and API key, anyone can make calls to the deployed LLM. Each call incurs a cost, so you need to prevent unauthorized usage. You should take steps to protect the API key from falling into the wrong hands, but you must use the API key in the score code to call the deployed LLM. Here are a few key management options and the potential risks of each. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, you can include the key in the score code used in SAS Model Manager and SAS Intelligent Decisioning. This gives anyone with access to the models or Python code files in SAS Viya the ability to view the key, and thus, use the model. You can restrict access to these resources in SAS Viya by leveraging the [access control rules](https://documentation.sas.com/?cdcId=sasadmincdc&cdcVersion=default&docsetId=evfun&docsetTarget=n1uw3er96phzpfn1pxvnf01f6sw3.htm) that are built into SAS Viya so that only a select few can view the models or Python code. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach can be made a bit better by encoding the key using the Base64 package and then adding logic into the score code to decode the key prior to making the REST API call. Anyone can decode the encoded key, but now the key is no longer stored as plain text. You can encode your key using this code:"

    "Anyone with access to the model, decision, or deployment can use it to make a call to the deployed LLM.

When calling the deployed model or decision, the individual must also pass the key as an input variable. When performing score tests or publishing validation tests in CAS, this writes the key to the CAS table, where it can be viewable to others. Also, when scoring using the SAS Micro Analytic Service, this can write the key to the log viewable by administrators. \n",

For example, in a Python environment where the model is executed, you can save an environment variable in this way: "

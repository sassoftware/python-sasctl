Unreleased
----------
**Improvements**
 - Refactor `tasks.py` to utilize `sasctl.pzmm` functions.
 - Add `model_info` class to better capture model information.

v1.9.1 (2023-05-04)
----------
**Improvements**
 - Updated handling of H2O models in `sasctl.pzmm`.
   - Models are now saved with the appropriate `h2o` functions within the `sasctl.pzmm.PickleModel.pickle_trained_model` function.
   - Example notebooks have been updated to reflect this change.

**Bugfixes**
 - Added check for `sasctl.pzmm.JSONFiles.calculate_model_statsistics` function to replace float NaN values invalid for JSON files.
 - Fixed issue where the `sasctl.pzmm.JSONFiles.write_model_properties` function was replacing the user-defined model_function argument.
 - Added NpEncoder class to check for numpy values in JSON files. Numpy-types cannot be used in SAS Viya.

----------
**Improvements**

   workflow prompts were not correctly submitted.  Note that the `input=` parameter was renamed to
   `prompts=` to avoid conflicting with the built-in `input()`.

 - Replaced the JSON cassettes used for testing with compressed binary cassettes to save space.
 - Updated the testing framework to allow regression testing of multiple Viya versions.
 - Refactored the authentication functionality in `Session` to be more clear and less error prone.  Relevant
   functions were also made private to reduce clutter in the class's public interface.
 - Began refactor for `sasctl.pzmm` to adhere to PEP8 guidelines and have better code coverage.

**Bugfixes**
